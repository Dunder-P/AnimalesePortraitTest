# Portrait Lip Flap Test Program
 Portrait Lip Flap Test Program made to assist artists using my code for lipFlaps.

To select portraits, copy and paste the path of each portrait into the respective field. On Windows, hold shift and right click and you will see the "Copy as Path" option.

 Automatically converts input text into Animalese for you to test the lip flap with. Can be used with a couple voicebanks, those being:
<ul>
<li>Dunder from Z Vocal Project</li>
<li>Haruno Sora (Cool)</li>
<li>Haruno Sora (Natural)</li>
<li>Zip</li>
<li>Zap</li>
<li>Zoup</li>
</ul>
I wouldn't actaully use Zap and Zoup cause their noise threshold is way too low.

If building from source you will need to obtain the Animalese plugin from here https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/animalese-110114.
The Haruno Sora voicebanks are also not in the source code, you will need to get that audio by buying either her SynthV or Voicepeak and then obtaining her Pitagoe voicebank from the AHS user site. (Her V5s might also include it as EXVoice)

If I read the license correctly using Haruno Sora's Pitagoe in the final build is okay as long as this isn't commercial and I keep it out of the repo.
